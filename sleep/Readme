Hello, Lukas Lopes here.

On this document, I will put all my thoughts on my decision making.

***
Time in bed interval and total time in bed.
        This information might be redundant, since, if we have the interval, we can calculate the total time in bed.
    Or, if we have time in bed start and total time, we can calculate when the time in bed ends.
        For the api, I will make only start time mandatory, but user should send bed end time or total time in bed. If the user sends both, (time end and total time),
    I will calculate the total time.
    For database, I will save both informations, this way its easier to to create filters or searchs on future.
